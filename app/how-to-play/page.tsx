          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            The goal of Minesweeper is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of
            them. You must use clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field to determine where the mines
            are located.

                mines are touching that cell (including diagonally). If it's empty, it will automatically reveal all
                adjacent empty cells until it reaches numbered cells.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            When you reveal a cell, you'll see a number from 1 to 8. This number indicates how many mines are in the
            eight cells surrounding that number (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).

            <li>
              <strong>1</strong> means one mine is touching that cell
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2</strong> means two mines are touching that cell
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3</strong> means three mines are touching that cell
            </li>
            <li>
              And so on up to <strong>8</strong> (all surrounding cells contain mines)

            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Start anywhere:</strong> Your first click is always safe. Click any cell to begin revealing the
              board.
            </li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Look for patterns:</strong> Find cells with numbers and count the surrounding unrevealed cells. If
              a "1" has only one unrevealed neighbor, that neighbor must be a mine.
            </li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Flag the mines:</strong> Right-click to place flags on cells you've determined contain mines. This
              helps you visualize the board and avoid clicking them accidentally.
            </li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Use process of elimination:</strong> If a "2" has two flags around it, all other surrounding cells
              are safe to click.
            </li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Work methodically:</strong> Don't rush. Take your time to analyze each number and its surroundings
              before making your next move.
            </li>
            <li className="leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Clear the board:</strong> Continue revealing safe cells and flagging mines until all non-mine
              cells are revealed. You win!

            <li>Start with the corners and edges - they have fewer neighbors to consider</li>
            <li>Look for "1-2-1" patterns which often indicate specific mine locations</li>
            <li>When stuck, look for cells with the most information around them</li>
            <li>Practice on Easy difficulty before moving to Medium or Hard</li>
